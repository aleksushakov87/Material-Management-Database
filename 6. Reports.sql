    REPORTING SCRIPT ‚Äì Material Management System

    This script generates a set of key reports that provide visibility into inventory levels, 
    material issuance, purchase order fulfillment, and distribution breakdown by subcontractor 
    and material category.
    
     These reports support operational visibility, accountability, and decision-making in 
    materials management.
